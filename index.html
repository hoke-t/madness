        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>The object of the game is to swap the 4 blue pegs on one side with the 4 red pegs on the other.
            You can jump or move forward one space, but never backward.
             You're considered a genius if you can do this in 4 tries or less. </p>
        <h2>Controls</h2>
        <p>
            To move a peg to an empty space, first click the peg, then the space
            in which you wish to move it. Remember, you can only move pegs towards
            the opposite side, and you can only move by jumping another peg or
            moving one space over.
