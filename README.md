# Madness
Implementation of the Madness board game in JS.

The object of the game is to swap the 4 blue pegs on one side with the 4 red pegs on the other. You can jump or move forward one space, but never backward. You're considered a genius if you can do this in 4 tries or less.

## Why?

I created this small JQuery based game as practice to obtain more experience.
